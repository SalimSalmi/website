                    <p>
                        Worked on several natural language processing applications on suicide helpline chat data. I used shallow as well as deep learning methods to tackle this complex dataset for unsupervised and supervised tasks. I developed methods that provided insights to the helpline on a macro level, as well as real-time tools to assist the helpline in their day to day tasks.

                        At Vialis I worked with on a traffic management application. I assisted the team with implementing new features as well as resolving current issues. Furthermore, I developed an extendable end-to-end testing suite, including tests for several important use-cases within the environment.
